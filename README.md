# Online_Planning_Walking_Unknown_Environment
This repo represents the MATLAB simulation examples of the framework for online path planning and online walk generalization using reconfigurable adaptive motion primitives. The details can be found in a paper "Human-Inspired Online Path Planning and Biped Walking Realization in Unknown Environment".

To test the code one should first add TBGnr_Model into a Matlab path. After that, inside each folder there are multiple simulation files that can be run.
